# Test 1

This is a simple test to get a simple C program working using VSCode.

Trying to follow this: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc

Opening my windows menu and typing 'develop' shows me 'Developer Command
Prompt for VS 2022' because I have visual studio 2022 installed.  I can
run 'cl' to run the microsoft c compiler.

I have the `C/C++` extension by microsoft installed.

Opening main.c I have the play button on the top-right of the source window
and I can hit it to debug.   The first time I had to select the cl.exe
compiler because it also detected gcc.

Nice, all done!

Time to add my [.gitignore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/C.gitignore) and create a repo.

Thanks for [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) too.
