# luatest

The purpose of this repository is for me to learn about developing
C/C++ in VSCode, and to use it to call LUAJIT.

I chose the [MIT LICENSE](LICENSE) because that's what LUAJIT uses.

## Setup

> NOTE: This is after writing 'test4', the README.md files in that
folder and earlier tests may have different instructions, but
these should work. 

This uses luajit as a submodule purely for convenience, to enable
relative paths for the builds for the include and library folders.
To include it, clone with `--recurse-submodules`, or after you
clone without that use `git submodule update --init`.  Sample:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://git@github.com:twi-ce/luatest.git

To build LUAJIT, open a `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022`, this means
you should have some version of visual studio 2022 installed.  Change to the
`luajit/src` subdirectory and run this to build it for static linking:

    msvcbuild.bat static

This is what the line looks like in the developer command prompt
because I cloned the repository into `c:\git\luatest2`:

    C:\git\luatest2\luajit\src>msvcbuild.bat static

## Building/Running

1. Clone repository with `--recurse-submodules` option
    * If you've already cloned it without, run `git submodules --init update`
2. Have Visual Studio 2022 installed with C/C++ functionality
3. Start "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022"
    * If you haven't once aleady, change to the `luajit/src` directory and run `msvcbuild.bat static`
4. Start vs code from the developer command prompt in the root directory with `code .`
5. Open one of the `.c` files, the `test1/main.c` for instance
6. Hit the 'play' button at the top-right of the source window to build and debug
    * The output should now be in a 'bin' subdirectory where the `.c` file is.

I use VSCode with the 'C/C++' extension from Microsoft.  While using a file such as `test1/main.c`
I saw the play button on the top-right of the editor.   This lets you build and run each c file
while editing it.  The first time it created `./vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` for
the extension and `.vscode/tasks.json` for the build.  I had to add these arguments to
`cl.exe` in `tasks.json` to add the `luajit/src`subdirectory for includes and libraries
and add the `.lib` files:

    "/I${workspaceFolder}/luajit/src",
    "/link \"/LIBPATH:${workspaceFolder}/luajit/src\" lua51.lib luajit.lib"

I also changed the `/Fe` option and added other options so output files would be created in the
`bin` subdirectory under the `.c` file (did this after the test4 commit, but after that
it should work for earlier ones also):

    "/Fe${fileDirname}\\bin\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
    "/Fd${fileDirname}\\bin\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.pdb",
    "/Fo${fileDirname}\\bin\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.obj",
    "/Fe${fileDirname}\\bin\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",

To debug in visual studio, use your developer command prompt and change to the directory and run:

    DevEnv /debugexe main.exe

## Possible problems

1. You didn't clone the luajit submodule, run `git submodules --init update`
2. You didn't start VS Code from the developer command prompt to set compiler environment variables
3. ??? - let me know if you have other issues
4. Compiling 64-bit, use `x64 native tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` when opening VS Code
    * Make sure to include `<stdlib.h>` when doing malloc or it assumes the return value is int.
    * Same for ALL libraries I assume for functions that return anything other than 32 bit int in 64 bit mode...
